## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Mobile-first workflow
- Included SVGs


### What I learned
- The fonts beautify the user interface. It was a great experience exploring the Fig Tree font from Google Fonts.
- I also started using Git for desktop which is now making it easier to deploy my projects.
- I also learned to use HTML5 semantic tags which makes it easier for machines the code and understand it.
